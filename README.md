Network Intrusion Detection System

## Problem Statement
An Anomaly based Intrusion Detection/Prevention System is a system for detecting computer intrusions by monitoring system activity and classifying it as either normal or anomalous.

## Data
This data is KDDCUPâ€™99 data set, which is widely used as one of the few publicly available data sets
for network-based anomaly detection systems.This data is from Kaggle. Link:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anushonkar/network-anamoly-detection

## PreProcessing and Model Building
The file for preprocessing and model building named "Network Anamoly Detection Final.ipynb" in Notebook folder is uploaded here.

## Integration
Integration of model is done in python flask framework with Frontend  in Html,CSS and Bootstrap
